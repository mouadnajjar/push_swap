# push_swap

## Overview
`push_swap` is a sorting algorithm project designed to efficiently sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The project emphasizes algorithmic thinking, optimization, and efficient use of resources, making it a core challenge in programming and problem-solving.

## Features
- **Sorting Algorithm**: Implements an efficient sorting strategy with minimal operations.
- **Pre-sorting with Chunks**: Divides the input into chunks for optimized sorting.
- **Custom Operations**: Utilizes specific stack operations (`sa`, `sb`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, etc.).
- **Checker Program**: Validates the correctness of the operations generated by the sorting algorithm.

## Requirements
- Language: **C**
- Libraries: Standard C library functions and custom utility functions.
- Tools: Makefile for compilation, Valgrind for memory checks (optional).

## How It Works
The program uses two stacks:
- **Stack A**: Contains the initial unsorted numbers.
- **Stack B**: Used as auxiliary storage during sorting.

### Key Steps:
1. **Pre-Sorting**:
   - Convert the input into an array and sort it.
   - Divide the array into chunks based on the range.
   - Push elements from Stack A to Stack B chunk by chunk, maintaining relative order.

2. **Sorting Stack B**:
   - Push the largest elements from Stack B back to Stack A in the correct order.

3. **Operations**:
   - Use stack operations (`sa`, `sb`, `ra`, `rb`, `pa`, `pb`, etc.) to manipulate the stacks efficiently.

## Operations
| **Operation** | **Description**                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `sa`          | Swap the first two elements of Stack A.          |
| `sb`          | Swap the first two elements of Stack B.          |
| `ss`          | Perform `sa` and `sb` simultaneously.            |
| `pa`          | Push the top element of Stack B to Stack A.      |
| `pb`          | Push the top element of Stack A to Stack B.      |
| `ra`          | Rotate Stack A (top becomes bottom).             |
| `rb`          | Rotate Stack B (top becomes bottom).             |
| `rr`          | Perform `ra` and `rb` simultaneously.            |
| `rra`         | Reverse rotate Stack A (bottom becomes top).     |
| `rrb`         | Reverse rotate Stack B (bottom becomes top).     |
| `rrr`         | Perform `rra` and `rrb` simultaneously.          |

## File Structure
- **src/**: Contains the source files for the project.
- **bonus/**: Contains additional files for the bonus `checker` program.
- **include/**: Header files for shared declarations.
- **Makefile**: Automates the compilation process.

## Usage
### Compilation
Run the following command to compile the program:
```bash
make
```
For the bonus `checker` program:
```bash
make bonus
```

### Running the Program
1. To generate operations for sorting:
   ```bash
   ./push_swap <numbers>
   ```
2. To validate the operations:
   ```bash
   ARG="<numbers>"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
   ```

### Example
```bash
ARG="4 55 752 41 5847 5574"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```
Expected output:
- `OK`: If the operations sorted the stack correctly.
- `KO`: If the stack is not sorted.
- `Error`: For invalid input or operations.

## Time Complexity
- **Pre-sorting**: \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Chunk Processing**: \( O(kn) \), where \( k \) is the number of chunks.
- **Overall**: Approximately \( O(n \log n) \).

## Testing
Use Valgrind to ensure no memory leaks:
```bash
valgrind ./push_swap <numbers>
```
